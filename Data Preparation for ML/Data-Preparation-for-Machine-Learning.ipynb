    "## Importante of Data Preparation ##\n",
    "* **Predictive modeling** projects involve learning from data\n",
    "* **Data refers** to examples or cases from the domain that characterize the problem you want to solve\n",
    "* On a predictive modeling project, such as classification or regression, **raw data** typically cannot be used directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main reasons why this is the case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Types**: ML algorithms require data to be numbers.\n",
    "* **Data Requirements**: Some ML algorithms impose requirements on the data.\n",
    "* **Data Errors**: Statistical noise and errors in the data may need to be corrected.\n",
    "* **Data Complexity**: Complex nonlinear relationships may be teased out of the data.\n",
    "* **Data Preparation**: The **raw data** must be pre-processed prior to being used to fit and evaluate a ML model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some data preparation methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Standardization** that standardizes the numeric data using the mean and standard deviation of the column.\n",
    "* **Normalization** most often means dividing by a norm of the vector. Scales numerical variables to the range between zero and one. *E.g., divide each pixel value of a image by 255.*\n",
    "* **Filtering** the data if we are interested in phenomenon of particular time or space scale.\n",
    "* **Replacing nan values** with some default values (mean, mode,...).\n",
    "* **Numerical data discretization**: transform numeric data into categorical data. This might be useful when ranges could be more effective than exact values. *E.g., high/medium/low temperatures might be more interesting than the actual temperature.*\n",
    "* **Outlier dectection**: outliers can be noises in terms of finding patterns in datasets. Using boxplot is possible to identify them.\n",
    "* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is used to reduce the dimensionality of data by creating new features. It does this to increase their chances of being interpret-able while minimising information loss."
